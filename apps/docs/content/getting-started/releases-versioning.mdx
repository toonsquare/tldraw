## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.3.0](/releases/v3.3.0)

Welcome to the 3.3.0 release of the tldraw sdk. This release includes a number of new features and bug fixes.

Special thanks to new contributors [@nayounsang](https://github.com/nayounsang) and [@vladh](https://github.com/vladh)!

## Whats's new

### tldraw sync updates

We've been working on [tldraw sync](https://tldraw.dev/docs/sync) to improve the developer experience and enable common use cases.

#### New 'readonly' mode

When adding a socket to a room, you can now specify whether the client should be in readonly mode.

```ts
room.handleNewSession({
	sessionId,
	socket,
	isReadonly: !(await canUserEdit(userId, roomId)),
})
```

Users in readonly mode:

- Will see a reduced UI, to hide tools and actions they can't make use of.
- Will not be able to make changes to the document. This is now enforced by the server.
- Will still send presence updates (cursor position, name, etc) to the server which will be broadcast to other users.

([#4648](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4648)) ([#4673](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4673))

#### New methods on TLSocketRoom

We've added a few new methods to the TLSocketRoom class:

- `closeSession` - for terminating or restarting a client's socket connection.
- `getRecord` - for getting an individual record.
- `getSessions` - for getting a list of the active sessions.

## Breaking Changes

No breaking changes in this release ðŸŽ‰

## Improvements

- Allow wheel events to pass through certain user interface elements like toolbars, to enable scrolling and zooming even when your cursor is not directly over the canvas. ([#4662](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4662))
- Allow holding `cmd`/`ctrl` modifier keys to add multiple shapes to the selection. Previously only `shift` worked. ([#4570](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4570))
- Allow the text tool to be locked ([#4569](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4569)) ([#4632](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4632)) ([#4644](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4644))
- Improve draw shape rendering performance during zoom interactions. ([#4647](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4647))
- Disable debug mode in development by default. ([#4629](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4629))

## Api Changes

- Adds an editor option to control the placement of quick action shortcuts (undo, redo, delete, etc). ([#4666](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4666))
- Adds an `editor.getIsReadonly()` helper method. ([#4673](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4673))

## Bug fixes

- Fix icon button width ([#4663](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4663))
- Fixed a bug where dropping images or other things on user interface elements would navigate away from the canvas ([#4651](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4651))
- Work around a Safari performance bug affecting arrows at certain zoom levels. ([#4636](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4636))
- Fix a bug that affected some geometry calculations for lines that start and end at the same point ([#4650](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4650)).
- Fix layer ordering issue with the watermark. ([#4656](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4656))
- Fixed a signals transaction bug that was manifesting as `Error('cannot change atoms during reaction cycle')` ([#4645](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4645))
- Fix a bug where the watermark link would open twice ([#4622](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4622))
- Fixed a bug where camera constraints were not upheld after switching pages or setting new camera constraints. ([#4628](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4628))
- Fixes a bug where arrow labels could be edited in readonly mode. ([#4673](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4673))
